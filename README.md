# Pickle158's Sports API Project
This is an API that will get the current Denver Nuggets game score using python and an API and print it on a mechanical 7 segment display.
The code for this was made in python, and is completely open source.  If you have any suggestions to make this better, it would be appreciated.  It is still a working progress, but its getting there.  

# How to get the API
I got my API from sportsdata.io  They aren't all that helpful, so it took a while to get this to work.  All you need is to get your free forever API trial, and obtain your API key.  Then, just put your key into the API key field of my code and it should work.

Thanks to POSTMAN API for help with testing and visualizing the results in a clean format with a clear editor, wouldnt have been able to do this without them.
